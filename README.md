### Hi there from Christian!
#### Who am I?
Previous leading up lives includes: delicately dishwashing plates, being a newborn baby photographer, pizza maker, and newspaper photo archive assistant. I'm now a fresh software developer trying to ease into contributing to open-source and build products. 

#### What am I working on right now.

As of November 2021, I am currently working as a Rails developer for [Helping Hands organization](https://helpinghandsapp.com/).

I am helping build on my open-source Ruby gem called [mynatra](https://github.com/christianarab/mynatra). I am also one of two developers working on an upcoming mobile fitness & habit forming app called 
[shimmy](https://github.com/Co-Lab-You-Belong-in-Tech/shimmy) 
with [Co.lab](https://www.joincolab.io/). \
