Previous leading up lives includes: delicately dishwashing plates, being a newborn baby photographer, pizza maker, and newspaper photo archive assistant. I'm now a fresh software developer trying to ease into contributing to open-source and build products. 

#### What am I working on right now.

I am helping build on my open-source Ruby gem called mynatra. I am also one of two developers working on an upcoming mobile fitness & habit forming app called
